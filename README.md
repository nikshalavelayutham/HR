# Description
A project to illustrate my understanding of basics of javascript.

# Project Details
I have done two projects.

One is an implementation of simple checkout page for a brick industry and the other one is simple data handling to list customer details and search functionality based on keywords.

# Steps to start the server
  - Download the project to a location
  - Install all required modules
  - > user@terminal# cd &#60;Project Download Location&#62;/HR
  - > user@terminal# npm install
  - Start the server
  - > user@terminal# node &#60;Project Download Location&#62;/HR/hr.js
  - After the server is started go to the project landing page https://localhost:8000/HR/hackreactorproject.html
  - The landing page has links to both the projects.
